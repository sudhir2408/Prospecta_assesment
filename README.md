Coding Challenge
 
Using https://api.publicapis.org/ complete the following tasks in any language/server.
 
Create an API that lists the title, description based on the category passed as an input parameter.Create an API that would save a new entry with all the relevant properties which retrieves values from the endpoint GET /entries.Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?
 
 
Theoretical Challenge
 
Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.
 
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
 
 
I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results.  If it is a value, then return a value.  If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.
 
How will you tackle the challenge above?
What type of errors you would you check for?
How might a user break your code?
